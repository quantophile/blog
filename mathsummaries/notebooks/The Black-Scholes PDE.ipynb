    "\n",
    "The natural interpretation of a risk-free asset is that it corresponds to a bank account with (possibly stochastic) short interest rate $r$. Note that, the bank-account is **locally risk-free**, in the sense that, even if the short rate is a random process, the return $r(t)$ over an infinitesimal time-period $dt$ is risk-free (that is deterministic, given the information available at time $t$). However, the return of $B(t)$ over a **longer interval** such as $[t,T]$ is typically stochastic.\n",
